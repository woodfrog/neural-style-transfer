# Neural Style Transfer

This project utilizies [fast_neural_style](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/fast_neural_style) to reproduce results of neural style transfer algorithms. Neural style transfer refers to manipulation of digital images to adopt appearance or visual style of another image. While [fast_neural_style](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/fast_neural_style) was implemented with neural networks, GPU is not needed for inferencing the network.
